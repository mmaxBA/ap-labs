Multithreaded City Traffic Simulator
====================================

Implement a multithreaded city traffic simulator where every car and semaphore will be independent entities.
Street directions and semaphores must be respected by the cars.

Technical Requirements
----------------------
- The city's map can be static or automatically generated.
- Cars and semaphore number can be configured on game's start.
- For every car, define a random start and destination point.
- Define a random speed for each car.
- If a car detect another car on his route and it's slower, it must slow down its speed.
- Each car and semaphore behaviour will be implemented as a separated thread.
- Cars and Semaphores threads must use the same map or city layout data structure resource.
- Display finished cars' routes.
- Display each car's speed.

General Requirements
--------------------
- Source code must be hosted in the class `ap-labs` repository.
- Make sure that you complete the below defined deliverables.
- Source code dependencies must be clearly documented.

Deliverables
------------
- Source code in each team's member repository (`ap-labs/challenges/city-traffic`).
- Architecture Document - [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Build/Run automation (`Makefile` and documentation - [CITY_TRAFFIC.md](CITY_TRAFFIC.md))
- Project's presentation (5-10 minutes)


Permitted programming languages
-------------------------------
- Multithreaded core backend
  - C
  - Go
- User Interface (optional)
  - Any
  - If it's terminal, output must be human-readable

Submission Details
------------------
- Read [Classify API](../../classify.md)

- **Extra 15% bonus**

  You can get an extra bonus if you implement an Artificial Intelleigence algorithm in semaphores synchronization.
